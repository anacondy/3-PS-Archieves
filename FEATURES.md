PS2 Archive Collection - Comprehensive Feature Registry1. Core ArchitectureFramework: React 18 (Functional Components + Hooks).Styling Engine: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first) with custom CSS injections for advanced animations (scanlines, CRT effects, particle floats).State Management: React useState / useRef for handling audio contexts, drag physics, and modal states.Device Compatibility: Responsive design optimizing layout for 16:9 and 20:9 aspect ratios (Mobile/Desktop).2. The "Archive Wall" (Home Page)Gapless Grid System: A CSS Grid layout with gap-0 to simulate physical DVD cases sitting flush against one another on a shelf.Interactive Covers:3D Hover Effect: Cards lift (scale-105) and apply a z-index boost on hover.Sheen Overlay: A CSS gradient mimics the plastic reflection of a DVD case.Header Strips: Dynamic rendering of top strips (PS2 PAL, NTSC, Xbox, etc.).Dynamic Metadata: Displays Title, Publisher, Rating, and Serial Number directly on the card.3. Audio Engine (v8 - Singleton)Hybrid Playback System:Mode A (Procedural): Generates audio in real-time using Web Audio API Oscillators (Sawtooth/Square waves) for specific frequencies.Mode B (File Based): Supports user-uploaded .mp3 and .wav files via createBufferSource.Fluid Audio Transitions:Bass Swell: Audio starts with a gain ramp-up (fade-in) to simulate a spinning disc motor.Release: Audio fades out smoothly over 1.5 seconds when stopped, avoiding "popping" sounds.Strict Cleanup: Automated disconnection of previous audio nodes to prevent overlapping sounds.Audio Reactivity: An AnalyserNode captures frequency data to drive visual jitter effects on the UI.4. The "God Mode" Editor (Settings Panel)Access: Triggered via secret key combo F + S (Hold 2s).Target Slot Selector:Create New: Adds a fresh entry to the grid.Overwrite/Edit: Select existing slots (numbered [ 1 ], [ 2 ]) to modify their data.Visual Editor:Image Upload: Drag-and-drop or Click-to-Upload support (JPG, PNG, GIF).Smart Centering: Auto-resets zoom and pan when a new image is loaded.Pan & Zoom: Interactive drag controls to position cover art within the frame.Text Overlays: Add custom text with selectable position (Top/Center/Bottom).Smart Padding: Text automatically shifts down to avoid overlapping with Header Strips.Typography Engine: 9 Google Fonts available (Horror, Sci-Fi, handwritten, etc.).Header Library: Toggles for PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, and Xbox styles.Timeline Editor:Draggable Pointers: Green (Start) and Red (End) handles to set loop points.Live Timestamp: Displays exact MM:SS for start/end points.Global Drag Tracking: Mouse tracking continues even if cursor leaves the bar area.5. System RegistryAccess: Triggered via secret key combo C + O + 2 (Hold 2s).Live Feedback:Particle System: Floating red nodes in the background.Blinking Cursor: Simulates a live DOS/Terminal environment.Content: Displays Author (Anacondy), Version, Origin Date, and a scrolling changelog.6. Zoom View (Detail Modal)Immersive Transition: Scale and Opacity animations when opening a game.Jitter Effect: The modal shakes slightly based on the bass intensity of the playing audio.Scanline Overlay: CRT-style lines overlay the image for retro atmosphere.Interactive Disc Drive: "Insert Disc" button triggers the audio engine.7. User Experience (UX)Feedback Systems:Progress Bars: Visual indicators when unlocking secret menus.Save Notification: "Writing to Memory Card" animation on save.Hover States: Red glows on close buttons and toggle switches.Input Logic:Smart Placeholders: Input fields clear hints automatically.Keyboard Shortcuts: Esc to close all modals.


PS2 Archive Collection - Project Status ReportDate: November 24, 2025Version: 3.1.4 (STABLE)Status: Core Functionality Complete1. What Has Been Done (Completed Features)A. Core User Interface[x] "Archive Wall" Grid: Implemented a responsive, gapless CSS grid that mimics physical game cases sitting flush on a shelf.[x] Interactive Covers: Added 3D hover effects, sheen overlays, and dynamic metadata (Title, Publisher, Rating).[x] Zoom/Detail View: Created a modal with smooth transitions, CRT scanlines, and an interactive "Insert Disc" button.[x] System Registry: A secret "hacker-style" information panel triggered by C + O + 2, featuring a live particle system and typing effects.B. Audio Engineering (v8)[x] Strict Singleton Architecture: Implemented a robust cleanup system (stopSound(true)) that forces disconnection of audio nodes before starting new tracks, solving all overlap issues.[x] Hybrid Playback: The engine supports both:Procedural: Real-time synthesis using Oscillators.File-Based: Upload and playback of user-provided .mp3 and .wav files.[x] Fluid Dynamics: Added "Bass Swell" (fade-in) and "Release" (fade-out) logic to prevent audio popping and make playback feel analog.[x] Visual Reactivity: Audio frequency data drives the "jitter" effect on the UI.C. The "God Mode" Editor (Settings Panel)[x] Access Control: Secure access via F + S (2-second hold) with visual progress feedback.[x] Slot Management: Added a dropdown selector with visual delta (numbered brackets [ 1 ], [ 2 ]) to Create New or Edit existing entries.[x] Edit Mode Persistence: Fixed logic to ensure editing an existing game correctly pre-loads its image, title, description, and audio settings.[x] Visual Editor:Click-to-Upload: Drag-and-drop or click zone for images.Smart Centering: Automatic zoom/pan reset on new uploads.Highlight Zone: Toggleable bounding box to preview text placement.[x] Customization Suite:Header Strips: Support for PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, and Xbox headers.Typography: 9 Google Fonts (Creepster, Orbitron, etc.).Text Positioning: Controls for Top, Center, and Bottom alignment with smart padding to avoid header overlap.[x] Timeline Editor:Draggable Pointers: Interactive Green (Start) and Red (End) handles.Live Timestamps: Exact MM:SS readout for loop points.2. Technical Architecture (Functions & Logic Used)Custom HooksuseAudioEngine: The heart of the application.Manages: AudioContext, OscillatorNode, GainNode, AnalyserNode.Functions: playSound() (handles routing), stopSound() (handles cleanup), playUiSound() (interface beeps).Key Logic: Uses requestAnimationFrame for the visualizer loop.useMultiKeyTrigger: Handles the secret key combinations.Logic: Tracks a Set of currently pressed keys and uses setInterval to drive the progress bar UI.Component LogicSettingsPanel:State: Manages extensive local state for the editor (zoom, offset, text settings, audio timeline).Drag Physics: Calculates mouse delta (clientX) relative to container rects for both image panning and timeline scrubbing.Target Slot Logic: Differentiates between creating a new ID vs. overwriting an existing ID in the gamesList array.App (Main):State Lift: Holds the master games array and availableTracks list to share between the Grid and the Editor.Render Logic: Conditionally renders Modals (Registry, Settings, Zoom) based on boolean flags.CSS & StylingTailwind CSS: Used for layout, spacing, and typography.Dynamic Styles: Injected via <style> tag for complex animations (@keyframes float-particle, @keyframes blink) and custom font imports.Grid Logic: Used grid-cols-2 through lg:grid-cols-5 with gap-0 for the seamless wall effect.3. What Is Left (Future Roadmap)While the current build meets all functional requirements, the following features would be the next logical steps for version 4.0:Data Persistence (High Priority)Current Status: Reloading the page resets all custom edits.Solution: Implement localStorage or IndexedDB to save the games array and custom assets (converted to Base64) so they persist across sessions.3D Case RotationCurrent Status: 2D CSS transforms (scale, rotate).Solution: Integrate Three.js or React-Three-Fiber to model a true 3D DVD case that can be spun around to view the back cover.Mobile Touch OptimizationCurrent Status: Works via click events (mapped to tap).Solution: Add swipe gestures for the timeline editor and "pull-to-close" gestures for modals.Theme SystemCurrent Status: Dark/Horror theme only.Solution: Add a toggle for "Light Mode" (Retro Store) or specific console themes (Xbox Green, Nintendo Red).
